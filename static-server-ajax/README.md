# Static Server

Simple NodeJS server, to work with history.pushState and static files.
This app returns json when requested by xhr, and will return text/html for simples get requests.

## Boilerplate for static sites
This repository also works as a static server boilerplate for sites.
I'm using Grunt: cssmin, uglify, watch

## Just three steps:

* clone this repository
* type ``` npm install ```
* then type ``` node app.js ``` on project root

Enjoy !
